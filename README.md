# Randomizer-Collection

This is just a little collection of the custom randomizers I've created in python, these methods are most likely already invented and exist in much better optimized forms than what I have created here. All of these randomizers use the python random package. in UniqueIntRandomizer.py and PseudoBoolRandomizer.py I make the outputs seem more random by making them less random. These randomizers aren't very practical but they can be the best option in some cases, I use the UniqueIntRandomizer.py's method in my discord bot for example to generate random indices for outputs.
